/**
 * Content-Based Filtering Recommendation Algorithm
 * Analyzes movie attributes to find similar movies
 * 
 * --- SIMPLE EXPLANATION ---
 * This is like a "Movie Matchmaker"! 
 * If you tell it you like "Toy Story", it looks at all other movies and asks:
 * 1. Is it a cartoon too? (Genre)
 * 2. Was it made by the same people? (Director)
 * 3. Does it have the same toys? (Cast)
 * The more "YES" answers it gets, the higher the movie's score!
 */

// Weights for different attributes (total = 1.0)

// Genre is the most important (30 points), like the type of toy (is it a car or a doll?).
// We use these points to decide which movie features matter most when picking.

  director: 0.10,     // Director style (Who made it)
  cast: 0.10,         // Cast overlap (Who is acting in it?)
